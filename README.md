# Utcazene

An unofficial app for Veszpr√©m's street music festival.

## TODO list before party

- finish unfinished stuff (use the website's content)
- notifications before pinned events
- drinking games
- ideas if there's time for it
  - "Where am I?" feature which shows you the current musician based on your location

## Pros against PWA

- sort and filter stuff however you want
- musicians and events can be pinned
- easier usage
- extra content

### Localization

In the [resources folder](./app/src/main/res) you can find the localization files in [values](./app/src/main/res/values) and [values-hu](./app/src/main/res/values-hu) folders. Every text is in the [strings.xml](./app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file and "message of the day" items are in the [motds.xml](./app/src/main/res/values/motds.xml) file.
